# Fruit Economy

This page is for a **very alpha** prototype which is still **actively** in development.

Fruit Economy is something I'm fiddling around with to play with the ideas of an evolving world where:

- There is minimal direct combat
- There's space for non-standard races
- Lots of things are generated, including as much as possible:
  - The tech tree
  - What's available for people in these civilisations to buy or trade

The art is going to be very basic to start, but that may change as things continue.

## Usage

FIXME

## How do I get `JWM`?

1) Go to [JWM's Build Artifacts](https://github.com/HumbleUI/JWM/actions/workflows/build-deploy.yml),
2) download the jars artifact from the latest working build, unzip it
3) use `mvn install:install-file -Dfile=<downloaded location>/jars/jwm-b3fecb126a.jar -DpomFile=<downloaded location>/jars/maven/META-INF/maven/io.github.humbleui/jwm/pom.xml`
