;;   picking between a bunch of options, eliminating any ones we can because we know we can't follow through with it,
;;   because we don't meet a prerequisite.
;;   Once a decision is decided, we then need to make some sub-decisions which for now we'll call choices.
;;   These choices are for figuring out details, for example: if we decide to claim a territory,
;;   the choice would be which one?
